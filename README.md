**Follow this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-sdk-node.html)**.
---This may require setting up a new AWS account---
1. Use the AWS Lambda Function Console to create a new trigger and function
   * Input the Device Serial Number (DSN) found on the back of the IOT button
   * Download the generated certificate and private key
2. Hold the IOT Button down for 5 seconds to start configuration mode
3. Connect to the IOT Button's network on your computer (Button ConfigureMe - XXX)

## Raspberry Pi Button
**Using: * Pi 2 Model B Rev 1.1 running Raspbian
         * Breadboard
         * 2 GPIO Jumper Wires (Power and Ground)
         * 1 GPIO Breadboard 4-Pin Button
         * Python 2.7
         * Libraries:
            * time - Python time
            * RPi.GPIO - GPIO Control
            * smtplib - Python email
            * MIMEMultipart - More complete emails (subject line)
            * MIMEText - More complete emails (subject line)**

### Hardware Setup
1. Attach the Jumper Wires from GPIO Pins to Breadboard
  * Power - GPIO \#18 (PIN \#12) -> Breadboard \#1B
  * Ground - GPIO \#39 (PIN GND) -> Breadboard \#2B
2. Attach the 4-Pin Button to Breadboard Pins \#1C, \#1F, \#3C, \#3F

3. Power on the Raspberry Pi

### Software Setup
1. Use VNC/SSH to connect to the Raspberry Pi
2. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Bravelemming/PushingAWSIotButton) into the Raspberry Pi
3. Create a Gmail account and set it up for SMTP
5. Replace the *to* and *from* email addresses in *email_button.py*
3. Run the script *email_button.py* with Python 2.7 as super user
   * `sudo python email_button.py`
   * DO NOT rename the file to *email.py* as this name is reserved by the SMTP Library.
4. Click the button! You shoud see a terminal message saying that the button has been pressed and receive an email!
